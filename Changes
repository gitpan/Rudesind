- Add missing prereq of File::Find::Rule, and make sure that
Rudesing::Build loads it with require, so installation doesn't blow up
before it can be detected as a prereq.

- Fix various bugs related to calculating raw and cached image paths.

- Documented all the modules.

- Failed admin logins redirected to a non-existent URI.

- Move some functions around.

- Replaced the term "directory" with "gallery" throughout the code and
style sheet.

- Use Class::Roles to implement captioning (it just seems more correct
than using inheritance here).
